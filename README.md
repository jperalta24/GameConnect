## Overview

Wow connect was built around the idea of community. We wanted to build a platform where you could interact with other players of World of Warcraft. What makes this application stand out is the ability to have a profile where you can design characters, see other players characters, interact with others content, and finally to meet up and play with others on a server. 

### The challenge

The purpose of this project was to show we could successfully build an application using the MVC model. To start we needed to find our concept and start building around that idea. Once we had our storyboard we need to plan the file structure, the models we would use, the routes, the handlebar displays, and finally the java script to bring it all together.

## The process

While building this project we generally all contributed and worked together on it during class hours. Jonathan was our team lead so between classes he would delegate additional tasks as well. Outside of the class work Jonathan worked on a lot of the routes, Spencer spent a portion of time building the layout and CSS. Shane and Johann helped contribute to routes, models, and additional tasks to bring the site together.  

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- javascript
- Node.js
- Express
- Sequelize


### Continued development

In the future We would love to have the ability to add character photos and be able to store those. We also believe having a live chat or forum built could really add to the site, and build the community feel we were trying to achieve. 

### Useful resources

- [Nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) - Helped us to utilize a new technology and send notifications when someone interacts with your posts. 
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) - We used sequelize to create and seed our database. 
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - We used express to create our routes. 
- [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) - We used node to create and run our server.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to acknowledge the great support we received from the class tutors, who helped us navigate through various issues. We also received support through outside tutors. Finally we had strong documentation to rely on. We were able to gather ideas from our class materials, and also nodemailer documentation for our added technology.
